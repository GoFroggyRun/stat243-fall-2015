Unless otherwise noted, all assignments should be completed by the
time of class, 2 pm. For problem sets, submission
is due at the start of class as a paper submission and via Github.
Instructions for other assignments will vary.

Unless otherwise noted, tutorials are found at
statistics.berkeley.edu/computing/training/tutorials.

Friday, Aug. 28: set up BCE on your own machine and (as needed if you
are not familiar with basic UNIX) work through the UNIX basics tutorial.
If you'd like to use the shell, git, and R on your own machine,
try to set that up too.

Monday, Aug. 31: work through the tutorial on using bash and hand in 
(at the beginning of class) a paper solution to questions 1-10 posed 
at the end of the tutorial. You do not need to work through
the sections on 'Command history and editing' or 'Regular expressions' 
(i.e., Regular expressions through the subsection on Perl). 

week of Aug. 31: if you are not familiar with R at the level of
modules 1-4,6 of the R bootcamp
(https://github.com/berkeley-scf/r-bootcamp-2015), work through those
modules and the breakout problems associated with the modules and
(optionally) attend the special catch-up session on R to be held
during the week.

Friday, Sep. 11 (tentative): first problem set (PS1) due.
