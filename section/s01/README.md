# Section 01: Git basics and formatting

## Git

First, we will go through some git basics. We will refer to the tutorial by
Jarrod Millman available on the [Berkeley SCF github
repo](https://github.com/berkeley-scf/tutorial-git-basics).

```
git clone https://github.com/berkeley-scf/tutorial-git-basics
```

We will not cover the entire tutorial, only the basics. Please complete it on
your own time.

## Submitting problem sets

We will go over submitting problem sets. You can find more info at
`section/submitting-electronically.txt` in this repo.

## Formatting

We will go over how to format problem sets using LaTeX + knitr or RMarkdown.

Some references we might look at:
