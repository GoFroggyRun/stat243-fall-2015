# Section 03: PS1 code review

Today will we will be doing a code review in groups.

Get into groups of about four to five people, preferably with people you didn't
work with on the homework. We will discuss one problem at a time, then a
representative from each group will come up and talk about the group's favorite
approach to the problem. At the end of every single problem, I will make a few
comments I think are important if they weren't touched on by anyone.

At the very end, I will have some comments about general code style and code
quality.

## post discussion section survey
